libgnomesu is a library for providing superuser privileges to GNOME 
applications. It supports sudo, consolehelper, PAM and su.

libgnomesu will use one the following services (in order of priority),
depending on which one is available:
- sudo
- consolehelper
- PAM
- su

Sudo support can be enabled using a GConf key since there is no way to
autodetect whether the user can use sudo without supplying a password.
This is the key: /desktop/gnome/superuser/use_sudo
The sudo backend supports the following features:
- Checking whether a password is needed (for when the sudo timestamp is
  still active, or when a password is not needed for a certain command).
- Asking for the password again if the entered password was incorrect.

libgnomesu will use the su-based backend as final fallback, if no other
services are available. This service uses a backend which is a modified
version of GNU su.

libgnomesu comes with the GUI frontend 'gnomesu' and a Nautilus component 
for Nautilus integration.
